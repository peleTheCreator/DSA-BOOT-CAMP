# Input : arr[] = {1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5}

#6.Move Zeros to End !!! 
# Our Task: Given a sorted array, the task is to remove the duplicate elements from the array. 
# Examples: 
# Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 3, 6} Output: 1 2 3 6 0 0 0 
# Input: arr[] = {0, 1, 9, 8, 4, 0, 0, 2, 7, 0, 6, 0, 9} Output: 1 9 8 4 2 7 6 9 0 0 0 0 0

#7 Left Rotate an Array by One !!! 
# Our Task: Given an array, the task is to Left Rotate an Array by One. 
# What is meant by the Left Rotation of an Array by One? Left Rotation means a rotation that happens Counter-Clockwise (anticlockwise). The elements are moved counterclockwise by one, which results in the elements moving back by one position from their initial position. 
# Example: 
# Input: arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5} Output: arr[] = {2,3,4,5,1} 
# Input: arr[] = {30,5,20} Output: arr[] = {5,20,30} 

def left_rotate_by_one(arr):
	temp= arr[0]

		arr[i]= arr[i+1]
	arr[len(arr)-1] = temp

	return arr




#8. Left Rotate an Array by D Places !!! 
# Our Task: Given an array, the task is to Left Rotate an Array by D places. 
# What is meant by the Left Rotation of an Array by D places? Left Rotation means a rotation that happens Counter-Clockwise (anticlockwise). The elements are moved counterclockwise by D number of places, which results in the elements moving back by D positions from their initial position. 
# Examples: 
# Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, d = 2 Output: 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 
# Input: arr[] = {3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 1, 2}, d=2 Output: 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 

def left_rotate(arr, d):
	return (arr[d:-1]) +(arr[0:d]) #list slicing





#9 Find the Leaders in an Array !!! 
# Our Task: Given an array, the task is to write a program to print all the LEADERS in the array. 
# What is a Leader? An element is a leader if it is greater than all the elements to its right side. And the rightmost element is always a leader. 
# For example: 
# Input: arr[] = {16, 17, 4, 3, 5, 2}, Output: 17, 5, 2 
# Input: arr[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 2}, Output: 5, 2 

def leader(arr):
	leaders=[] 
	last_leader = arr[-1]                #//the last value is always a leader
	leaders.append(last_leader)

	for i in range(len(arr)-2, -1, -1):  #//count and decrement from the last value
		if arr[i] > last_leader:      #// any value greater than the last leader is the new last leader
			last_leader = arr[i]
			leaders.append(last_leader)  # append the values

	return leaders.reverse()


#10: Maximum Difference Problem with Order !!! 
# Our Task: Given an array arr[] of integers, find out the maximum difference between any two elements such that the larger element appears after the smaller number. 
# Examples : 
# Input : arr = {2, 3, 10, 6, 4, 8, 1} 
# Output : 8 
# Explanation : The maximum difference is between 10 and 2. 
# Input : arr = {7, 9, 5, 6, 3, 2} 
# Output : 2 
# Explanation : The maximum difference is between 9 and 7.

def maximum_differene(arr):
	max_value = arr[len(arr)-1]
	max_difference = 0

	for i in range(len(arr)-2, -1, -1):
		if arr[i]<max_value:
			max_diff=max(max_diff, max_value-arr[i])
		else:
			max_value = arr[i]

	return max_difference
