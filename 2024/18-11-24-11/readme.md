## README: Instructions for Writing Solutions

This repository contains tasks to be solved programmatically. Follow the instructions below to ensure consistency and clarity in your code.

---

### General Guidelines:
1. **Program Files**:
   - Write each solution in a program file with an appropriate extension such as `.py` (Python), `.js` (JavaScript), or other programming languages of your choice.

2. **Function Names**:
   - Use clear and descriptive names for functions. For example, for a task to find the largest element in an array, name the function `find_largest_element`.

3. **Comments**:
   - Include comments where necessary:
     - Describe the purpose of the function at the beginning.
     - Comment on any complex logic.
     - Explain the parameters and return values, if not self-explanatory.
